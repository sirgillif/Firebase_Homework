Week 7 Assignment - Rock Paper Scissors

Overview

In this assignment, you'll indeed create another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? You're going to make this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of your web development repertoire)!

Remember
  - You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of the Mon/Tue class.

Some Notes Before you begin
  - Whether you finish the game or not, you must hand in your code by midnight August 13th, 2016 to avoid having your work marked incomplete. We don't expect every student to finish this assignment. Still, we do want to see you program this game as best you can.

When Should You Be an Expert with the Concepts from This Homework?
  - By Week 9. Try your absolute best to finish this homework. Remember: you have two weeks to ace this exercise.

Setup
1. Create a GitHub repo called RPS-Multiplayer and clone it to your computer.
2. Create a file inside of your RPS-Multiplayer folder called index.html. This is where your page's HTML will go.
  - Don't forget to include jQuery and Firebase.
3. Inside RPS-Multiplayer, create your assets directory.
  - Create the folders and files you typically place in assets -- just like you had for the prior weeks' homework assignments.

Instructions
  - Create a game that suits this user story:
      - Only two users can play at the same time.
      - Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
      - The game will track each player's wins and losses.
      - Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.
      - Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
